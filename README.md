# front-detail-E2-pack
So you decided to look at this

so far we only have front plows for EMD locomotives

ALCo detail units coming soon

we have Strike plate, foot board, large/regular plow, and ditchlight and ditchlightless versons of the E2

First put the folder above into your adv dupe 2 folder

Then load gmod and place down the dupe
(the E2's are in the dupe)

if your having troubles of where to put the E2 on the locomotive take a look at the Demonstrator

if you feel like it you can make a folder with the plows in it
